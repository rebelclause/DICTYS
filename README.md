# DICTYS
DICTYS (tentatively) Distributed Instrumentation Collection of Thermal Gamma Sensing

"When Acrisius discovered that DanaÃ« had given birth to a son, he threw both mother and son into a chest, and put them out to sea; but Zeus caused the chest to land in the island of Seriphos, one of the Cyclades, where Dictys, a fisherman, found them, and carried them to his brother, king Polydectes."

DICTYS originates out of HAPI and may be forked into HAPI.

This GIT repository exists to define DICTYS and contain its collateral.

The project is inspired by the 10,000 year clock of TheLongNow to maintain and support longevity of the human species. It's inspired by Space Agencies and private companies around the world working toward multi-planet multi-system colonization. And it's inspired by applied intelligence, the foresight humans have always required to improve individual and collective food, water, and human security, and overall quality of life. 

DICTYS maintains that adaptation is a human strength forged in the crucible of change. Crisis to human beings often creeps rather than leaps. That includes changes to climate which, over the course of a a single human lifetime, are very difficult to detect on geologic cycles, since the record of change is so indirect.

We find indicators in the fossil record; ancient water, remnants of archaea, geologic locked deposits of biomass, zoomass, volcanic ash, eroded river runoff, etc. The difficulty of predicting the original pattern of local change on a given hour or day on Earth even 200 years from now is staggering. No climate model could do it. Global atmosphereic silt transport and deposition can be regular enough to show patterns, but these patterns are general by comparison to hour on hour collected data. So like you would have to generalize silt deposition did occur in one large region and another some time in the past -- whose time and date we can't be sure of -- so, too, the record of temperature, pressure and humidity, data even more temporally vaporous to you, the future farmer, researcher, or water drinker.

You know deposition did occur, and that, perhaps, it was only detectable because fossil fuel use and tire pollution suddenly 'back then' ended. You know a human being drank enough water to live because signs there was a sustained site of human habitation exist. But you can't know without records what the temperature was on day_X when all the people suddenly abandoned a city because in region_L frost killed the entire crop last year.

Without foresight humans are susceptible to the creeping crisis, the undetectable change in stability and local influence of long term environmental conditions.

Extending that, for human being, you and me, to be ready to become and thrive as a planet-hopping species none of use can afford to compromise our social natures by allowing the data we need to be impeded in its collection, sharing or dissemination. Ultimately, each of us is responsible for ourselves, but if we must house a portion that responsibility and institutionalize it, that's what we do to prevent any one of us from being placed at risk by agenda driven mushrooming. That will hold on this planet, and on on any other homo sapiens sapiens decides to go.

In the U.S. NASA has had some trouble, like the EPA, in maintaining climate protection related programs, specifically, in the case of NASA, earth monitoring programs that support climate protection by way of providing facts for policy development.

If there are no facts, however, what does that say about any actions taken, or perhaps worse, not taken?

The people of the United States aren't the only people in the world who benefit from NASA's earth monitoring and climate modeling expertise. Governments around the world participate, and international top talent matriculates through the organization, helping to set a worldclass example, producing experts capable of using the accumulated data to improve lives and lifetime outcomes everywhere on the planet.

The idea behind DICTYS is to aggregate solar powered on-the-ground sensing data from all over the world to one forever bank everyone can visit, and every participant can use.

As a failover mechanism upon Administrative butchery, or as an enhancement to Earth monitoring as it exists**, DICTYS is a project we can all participate in, one that reflects values of the HAPI project, to support and enhance food and water security. 

The project will be an aid to food security from climate disruption, a blanket layer of actionable data. In the development horizon, additional benefits include near-real time and historical data analytics open source capabilities, capabilities that leverage unique talents and viewpoints to round out the picture of planet Earth.

Today, we are crowdsourcing many unique and valuable open source projects, building up the digital ecosystem and enriching local level decision support. One of our future stories could be understanding and communicating early warning soil failure scenarios linked, perhaps, to wildfires and famine. Another might be sharing know how to solve water scarcity issues between peoples living in areas it was never known until DICTYS were dealding with the same cyclic weather patterns or crisis.

Climate change, whatever its source, has a palpable impact on the availability of water resources in many parts of the world producing both positive and negative effects on agriculure as a consequence.

Because NASA's earth monitoring is an important component of its science and technology readiness for planetary colonization, when earth monitoring is at risk, the technologies that will help us understand new environments where we might hope to journey together to live could also be at risk, becoming too expensive, in the minds of Administrators, to be considered important enough to move forward.

Fortunately, the Smart Device technology behind HAPI is universally adaptable. Literally.

Powered by solar and populated with HAPI open source programming, presently under continous active development for hydroponic and aquaponics systems and DICTYS, the Pi Zero W becomes a uniquely versatile and capable Smart Device gathering sensing data over the Internet and operating within fault tolerant networks.

The first generation firmware will allow solar powered Smart Devices to gather data and use a wireless connection to report time coded temperature, and, optionally, humidity and pressure data from the local environment. Enclosures for devices can be manufacturered by anyone, though we recommend for the program, until others are proven, housings designed and fabricated by Volunder Waycraft, a HAPI partner.

Cost of entry into the program is estimated at roughly $111 for all equipment options and the first year of subscription, with an annual maintenance cost of $1 per month, or $12 per year in subsequent years.

** NASA's InSight mission augments remote orbital reconnaisance of the Red Planet and adds to the arsenal of ground based observation, but by NASA's own admission for a complete climate picture distributed sensing would be required.
