# DICTYS
DICTYS (tentatively) Distributed Instrumentation Collection of Thermal Gamma Sensing

"When Acrisius discovered that DanaÃ« had given birth to a son, he threw both mother and son into a chest, and put them out to sea; but Zeus caused the chest to land in the island of Seriphos, one of the Cyclades, where Dictys, a fisherman, found them, and carried them to his brother, king Polydectes."

DICTYS originates out of HAPI and may be forked into HAPI.

This GIT repository exists to define DICTYS and contain its collateral.

The project is inspired by the 10,000 year clock of TheLongNow to maintain and support longevity of the human species. It's inspired by Space Agencies and private companies around the world working toward multi-planet multi-system colonization. And it's inspired by applied intelligence with foresight into improving individual and collective food, water and human security. 

DICTYS maintains that adaptation is a human strength forged in the crucible of change often tempered by change to the stability of long term environmental conditions, that to be ready as a planet-hopping species we can not compromise on our letting our social nature be impeded when the sharing of information is impeded and puts any one of us at risk, on this planet on on any other where conditions may wildly differ from the ones our species originates in.

In the U.S. NASA has had some trouble, like the EPA, in maintaining climate protection related programs, specifically, in the case of NASA, earth monitoring programs that support climate protection by way of providing facts for policy development.

If there are no facts, however, what does that say about any actions taken, or perhaps worse, not taken?

The people of the United States aren't the only people in the world who benefit from NASA's earth monitoring and climate modeling expertise. Governments around the world participate, and international top talent matriculates through the organization, helping to set a worldclass example, producing experts capable of using the accumulated data to improve lives and lifetime outcomes everywhere on the planet.

The idea behind DICTYS is to aggregate solar powered on-the-ground sensing data from all over the world to one forever bank everyone can visit, and every participant can use.

As a failover mechanism upon Administrative butchery, or as an enhancement to Earth monitoring as it exists*, DICTYS is a project we can all participate in, one that reflects values of the HAPI project, to support and enhance food and water security. 

The project will be an aid to food security from climate disruption, a blanket layer of actionable data. In the development horizon, additional benefits include near-real time and historical data analytics open source capabilities, capabilities that leverage unique talents and viewpoints to round out the picture of planet Earth.

Today, we are crowdsourcing many unique and valuable open source projects, building up the digital ecosystem and enriching local level decision support. One of our future stories could be understanding and communicating early warning soil failure scenarios linked, perhaps, to wildfires and famine. Another might be sharing know how to solve water scarcity issues between peoples living in areas it was never known until DICTYS were dealding with the same cyclic weather patterns or crisis.

Climate change, whatever its source, has a palpable impact on the availability of water resources in many parts of the world producing both positive and negative effects on agriculure as a consequence.

Because NASA's earth monitoring is an important component of its science and technology readiness for planetary colonization, when earth monitoring is at risk, the technologies that will help us understand new environments where we might hope to journey together to live could also be at risk, becoming too expensive, in the minds of Administrators, to be considered important enough to move forward.

Fortunately, the Smart Device technology behind HAPI is universally adaptable. Literally.

Powered by solar and populated with HAPI open source programming, presently under continous active development for hydroponic and aquaponics systems and DICTYS, the Pi Zero W becomes a uniquely versatile and capable Smart Device gathering sensing data over the Internet and operating within fault tolerant networks.

The first generation firmware will allow solar powered Smart Devices to gather data and use a wireless connection to report time coded temperature, and, optionally, humidity and pressure data from the local environment. Enclosures for devices can be manufacturered by anyone, though we recommend for the program, until others are proven, housings designed and fabricated by Volunder Waycraft, a HAPI partner.

Cost of entry into the program is estimated at roughly $111 for all equipment options and first year subscription, with an annual maintenance cost of $1 per month, or $12 per year in subsequent years.
